# Bank Customer Churn with Artificial Neural Network
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Customer churn, which refers to customers leaving a company's services, is a pressing concern for financial institutions. By leveraging ANNs, this project aims to forecast potential churners and assist the bank in retaining valuable customers.

# Business Problem
The financial industry faces the challenge of customer churn, where customers discontinue their relationship with the bank. This attrition can adversely affect the bank's financial performance and reputation. The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn. By anticipating potential churners, the bank can implement targeted strategies to prevent customer attrition, such as offering personalized incentives, improving customer service, and enhancing communication.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises a comprehensive collection of customer-related data, including demographic information, account details, transaction history, and customer behaviors. The dataset also features a binary target variable indicating whether a customer has churned or not. The inclusion of diverse data points empowers the model to uncover intricate patterns that influence customer churn.

# Results and Insights
The trained ANN model demonstrates its ability to predict customer churn. By analyzing evaluation metrics, visualizations, and feature importance, the bank can uncover insights into customer behavior and the factors that drive churn. These insights are instrumental in refining retention strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction, and bolstering the bank's bottom line.
